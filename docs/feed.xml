What I will discuss is how elegantly RESTful architecture makes backend to front-end relationship an ideal structure for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a front-end developer at Columbia University, I’ve had the pleasure of working with other developers’ APIs. Now, the API might not be considered RESTful that we were working with (a level 1 or 2 on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html&quot;&gt;Richardson Maturity Model&lt;/a&gt;) but the structure is close enough. The project allowed for me to focus solely on the user experience and design of the client side experience without having to worry about server side template rendering, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; as the front-end framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API I was connecting to was populated with dummy data while he worked on writing the backend logic. As he finished the results changed organically as it was committed and pushed. But how is this better than the typical server-side template processing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for one the API creates a clear distinction between front-end and backend. When the templates are processed on the server side, developers can step on each other’s toes. In Drupal, for example, the addition of a module can change how some results are written completely, making the front-end dev adjust their code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another bonus for RESTful APIs is versioning. If major changes occur to the structure of the API, you can progress to another version number without retiring the old API until you’re ready. While this can be done with most LAMP frameworks, it’s a more convoluted process and again, messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing the templates on the client side saves you server processing resources. For large scale applications, this can mean hundreds of dollars. It also gives you more flexibility with scaling, letting your resources focus on the computations and leaving the client to render the aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If you’re a front-end developer, chances are you’ve worked with an API, whether it’s RESTful or not is another story that will not be addressed here.

I moved from the center of Pennsylvania to the heart of the American empire, NYC. Since moving here I’ve seen countless concerts, gone to talks at Google’s NYC HQ, and sampled foods from all over the world. And given everything that’s been happening to the country, I’ve branched away from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.progcode.co/&quot;&gt;Progressive Coders Network&lt;/a&gt; and founded a new political development group.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A little about the new job…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before at Penn State I wore all the hats. And by that I mean I had sysadmin, programmer, designer, QA, webmaster, information architect, etc… responsibilities. Never could I find time to focus on any one field, I found myself overloaded quickly, and at a less than desirable pay rate. Columbia University found me and relived a lot of that stress. I’m now on their Interactive Services team as a front-end engineer. We’re mostly working in Drupal, with some headless builds and some AngularJS/RESTful apps filling in gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the transition was smooth, busy, but smooth. I’ll be visiting Penn State this weekend for a bit of fun and to pickup a few things. Everything went well and that’s all I can ask for.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="PA," /><category term="NYC," /><category term="job" /><category term="upgrade," /><category term="political" /><category term="action" /><summary type="html">There have been several major updates since I last posted.

&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been getting awesome feedback on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ndkline/rhs_intern_db&quot;&gt;Internship Aggregate&lt;/a&gt; I launched at the end of summer. The students are telling faculty/staff in that unit how much they like the tool, how easy it is to use, etc. Basically they’re confirming the UX has been improved significantly since the original ColdFusion service launched. Best part is, I could scale the new architecture to serve the whole University basically overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: The unit that requested it wanted it behind a login so no one outside their unit could use it or even see it. PSU bureaucracy at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I’m very pleased with the application’s reception amongst its users. Feel free to fork the project on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ndkline/rhs_intern_db&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-overview&quot;&gt;Technical Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was brought into this project by our lead programmer when the request was made for the update to an internship database. They were wanting an update to the look and feel of the site, essentially a UX overhaul. The old application was built in ColdFusion at around the turn of the century, so needless to say it in fact did need a huge facelift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to retain the backend “CMS” portion of the application and expose the content via a RESTful API. Once we got that working, I took the front-end and Joe (the other programmer) took updating the backend. We were able to work incredibly well since the my front-end design is only dependent upon the API. It was one of the most fluid front-end/backend collaborations I’ve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RESTful API and CMS were built in, or remained in, ColdFusion while I used AngularJS as a front-end framework and Zurb Foundation for scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="ColdFusion," /><category term="AngularJS," /><category term="Restful," /><category term="API," /><category term="Internship" /><category term="Aggregate," /><category term="Zurb," /><category term="Foundation" /><summary type="html">Reception of a New Tool</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Launching the Center for Education and Civil Rights Website</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/10/05/new-post.markdown.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Launching the Center for Education and Civil Rights Website" /><published>2016-10-05T14:51:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-05T14:51:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/10/05/new-post.markdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/10/05/new-post.markdown.html">&lt;p&gt;Today we are launching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cecr.ed.psu.edu/&quot;&gt;Center for Education and Civil Rights&lt;/a&gt; (CECR) website. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rossdc.com/&quot;&gt;Ross Designs and Consulting&lt;/a&gt; was contracted to build the site and produced quality work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my start with the Carrara Education Technology Center, or CETC, I have been tasked with designing and developing a new web presence for the College of Education. If you visit their &lt;a href=&quot;ed.psu.edu&quot;&gt;current site&lt;/a&gt; and explore a little bit, you will notice it’s rather challenging to navigate to information that would be desirable to most types of people that would visit the site, students, faculty, prospective students, etc… It’s easy to drill down into content and get lost. Content is also slow to be written, edited, and published. The technical side of our infrastructure is even worse; We run Plone on Windows servers with a caching Varnish (Linux) server. This is a gross simplification of our current stack, however the point I’m making is that the bar of entry on any of our projects is rather steep for most developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve these issues I decoupled our website’s public views and CMS to focus on the content creation process. I nixed Plone and our expensive Windows servers for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; 7 and comparatively Linux servers. Within Drupal I was able to rapidly define content creation workflows for our staff and expose the data via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&quot;&gt;RESTful services&lt;/a&gt;. By splitting the CMS and public views apart, I am able to focus development on either backend and front-end. The backend would be Drupal and front-end will be in &lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/&quot;&gt;ReactJS&lt;/a&gt;, or another front-end JavaScript framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CETC website will serve as the Drupal portion of the previously described stack. Any other site we build will consume the content via the RESTful service. As we grow our content, I will be able to build a specialized team around this architecture. The backend team will work within Drupal and front-end team will focus on AngularJS/ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Drupal," /><category term="d7," /><category term="drupal" /><category term="7," /><category term="Plone," /><category term="RESTful," /><category term="CETC," /><category term="Carrara" /><category term="Education" /><category term="Technology" /><category term="Center," /><category term="CMS," /><category term="Headless" /><summary type="html">The Carrara Education Technology Center is proud to announce the Alpha launch of it’s website found at cetc.ed.psu.edu.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/06/20/hello-world.markdown.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World!" /><published>2016-06-20T15:51:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-06-20T15:51:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/06/20/hello-world.markdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/06/20/hello-world.markdown.html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s first program, “Hello World.”&lt;/p&gt;
